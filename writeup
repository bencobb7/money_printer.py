  There were many things that surprised me when running this program. The thing that stands out to me the most is how few times the program results in a "bust", or when funds are less than the minimum bet. With the minimum bet being 5% of the total starting funds, out of 1000 rounds of 1000 coin flips, the most I saw the program bust was 8 times. Even then, the average ending amount, or how much money the program walks away with at the end, was always in the hundreds of thousands if not millions. And all of that is assuming a starting budget of a measly $1,000. 

  It is interesting to me that based on these simulations, given a situation where the odds were exactly 50/50, you are nearly guranteed to walk away with a massive profit if you follow this betting strategy. Of course, in a real world betting scenario, the odds are never going to be 50/50. Even in a game like blackjack, where the odds are considered to be most favorable for the bettor, it is still tilted in the casinos favor. Even though this is an unrealistic exercise, it is still fun to imagine a world where this could be put to practical use.

  Overall, this was a fun exercise in Python and an interesting look at statistics in action.
